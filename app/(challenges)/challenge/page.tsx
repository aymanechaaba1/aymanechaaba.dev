          The amount of tech you will learn along with all the free goodies that
          you will receive will definitely be worth it!
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of Day 5, you would have an incredible AI SaaS App that can
          generate revenue for you!{' '}

          you will receive will definitely be worth it!

          You will receive an extra 10 points in the challenge per referral. In

          University of Code.

          If you want to <strong>WIN</strong> the AI SaaS Challenge then
          homework submission every day is essential!

        <p>
          However, if you just want to learn and have the AI SaaS App on a
          portfolio that we will provide to you, then just show up and code
          along. Just make sure to be there for the Grand Finale on Day 5!

          We want your experience to be interactive and personal, so we have
          limited seats. This gives you plenty of opportunities to ask questions
          and interact with one another during the 5 Days of the AI SaaS
